      `My first experience with programming was a C# book my dad tried to make me read when I was 13. I didn't understand anything and it only made me frustrated so he let me stop, but not before begrudingly telling me it was "meant for beginners."`,
      `The next time would be in my freshmen year of college, where I barely passed my Intro to CS class and failed the next one in the series. I wouldn't touch programming again until 3 months before I graduated, where I decided on a whim (and because of COVID) to take a fairly intensive online Java course which I managed to complete in 2 months.`,
      `Now after a stint at a bootcamp, I'm balancing job applications, learning/improving my technical skills, and writing. I hope to be able to continue to grow my career and build projects that are both interesting and challenging, as well as continue to tell stories through my writing!`,
